Memo

About:
Memo is a shoppinglist application mainly designed for Windows Mobile 5.0 (IE Mobile). It's written in xhtml/css and javascript using cookies to store data. As it's just a web application it could work just fine on any device or computer with a browser that implements enough of the javascript language.
