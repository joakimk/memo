What works?
* It runs somewhat good in firefox, except for the bugs :)

Bugs:
* When adding and removing out of order, items refuse to move
  visually, but still adds itself multiple times...

Limits:
* The key's to identify items are the name, unmodifed.
  - Only one-word names are supported.
* There are no delete.
* Assignment to .id does not work for WM5.0

What I want:
* A way to REMOVE the item. It worked flawlessly when parentNode
  was used (but then it would not run at all on WM5.0).

Limitations on Windows Mobile 5.0:
- No .parentNode
- You can't change .id.
